# Star Hack League (SHL)
Star Hack League is a league for hackathon competitors to hone their programming and creative skills to create new software programs.

In addition to creating great software, members of SHL will be able to earn points for placements in hackathons. Using both a ELO and Star System, hackers can accurately evaluate themselves and enter hackathons suited for their experience level.

## Rankings
Hackers do not need to understand how the ratings and ELO calculations work. Generally, positive placements will gain you points while negative placements will lose you points. These are OVERALL placements not catagory placements.

Hackers are ranked into 5 star groups. Everyone will begin on first star but can accelerate through the ranks through consistant top placements.

| ⭐ Division | Percentile | Approximate ELO Numbers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⭐ | 0-50th | 100-800 |
| ⭐⭐ | 51-70th | 801-1500 |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | 71-85th | 1501-2000 |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 86-95th | 2001-2500 |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 95-99th | 2500+ | 

Depending on the type of tournament that one places, hackers can win or lose ELO. For competitions under 3 stars, participation will always give you points. This is to encourage people to attend more hackathons even if they do not place high in them. Unless of Official SHL Hackathons, these scoring applies:
